# liver_res_unet

**liver_res_unet** is a deep learning project focused on the segmentation and detection of liver tumors in CT images using a custom ResUNet architecture. This repository implements a state-of-the-art approach that combines the advantages of U-Net and ResNet, resulting in an efficient, accurate, and robust model for medical image segmentation.

## Key Features

- **ResUNet Architecture:**  
  Combines U-Net’s encoder-decoder structure with ResNet’s residual blocks to enable effective feature extraction and easier training of deep networks.
  
- **Liver Tumor Segmentation:**  
  The model performs pixel-wise segmentation to accurately delineate liver and tumor regions in CT scans.
  
- **Advanced Pre-processing:**  
  - **DICOM Handling:** Reads and processes CT scan images.
  - **Hounsfield Windowing:** Adjusts pixel intensities within a specific range ([−100, 400]) to enhance contrast.
  - **Histogram Equalization:** Increases image contrast to better differentiate liver tissue from surrounding structures.
  - **Data Augmentation:** Uses techniques such as image flipping and rotation to mitigate class imbalance and improve model robustness.
  
- **Comprehensive Evaluation Metrics:**  
  The performance is assessed using:
  - **Dice Score:** Measures the overlap between predicted and true segmentation masks.
  - **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Evaluates the accuracy of the segmentation.
  - **Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity:** Provide further insights into the model's performance, especially in handling imbalanced classes.

- **Dataset:**  
  This project uses the publicly available **3Dircadb01** dataset, which consists of 3D CT scans of patients with liver tumors. The dataset is pre-processed into 2D slices with corresponding masks for liver, tumor, and other anatomical structures.

## Repository Structure

- **data_preprocessing/**  
  Scripts for reading DICOM files, applying Hounsfield windowing, histogram equalization, and data augmentation.
  
- **models/**  
  Implementation of the ResUNet model using TensorFlow/Keras, including residual block definitions and the full network architecture.
  
- **training/**  
  Training scripts and configuration files for model training, including evaluation metrics and checkpointing.
  
- **results/**  
  Example outputs, evaluation metrics, and confusion matrices from model testing.

## Results

- **Dice Score:** High overlap in liver segmentation (up to ~99.3%) and promising performance for tumor segmentation (~95.2%).
- **IoU:** Reflects a robust segmentation of the background and liver regions.
- **Accuracy & Specificity:** Model demonstrates high overall accuracy (>97%) and perfect specificity in detecting non-tumor regions, highlighting its potential in clinical applications.
